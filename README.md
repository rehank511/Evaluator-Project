# Evaluator-Project
The project is divided in 3 parts starting with scanner, parser and then evaluator. The language evaluated was a made up language.

Please Read "instruction.txt" for compiling steps

The Scanner takes in a given language and scans out all the tokens like number, identifier, operator.
# Then
The Parser takes in the given language and makes a tree out of in the travere order of how the code should be implemented.
# Then 
The Evaluator takes in that tree and evaluates the language and gives out the output.
